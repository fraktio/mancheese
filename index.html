                    <p>
                        Mancheese is an exclusive delicacy that is highly appraised for its sophisticated taste which is
                        originated from its unique raw material: the male breast milk. Male breast milk has unique
                        properties that makes it not only very demanding but also rewarding raw material for coagulation.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                        There is of course many steps when making cheese and most of these doesn't really differ much from
                        making more mundane types of cheese. One that needs to be mentioned is that our Mancheese is often
                        beer washed. All of our cheeses are cave aged at least one full year before they are considered
                        ready for consumption. Taste of Mancheese is usually described as 'strong', 'full' and 'rich'.

                    </p>
                    <strong>In short the Mancheese is a cheese of exceptional quality made from male breast milk.</strong>

                    <p>Male mammals are as capable of lactating as their female counterparts.
                       Nature just doesn't provide males the natural stimulant to do so.
                       Lactation can be induced via dysregulation of certain hormones and/or excessive nipple stimulation.
                       Male lactation is well known phenomenon in medicine and its known as male galactorrhea.
